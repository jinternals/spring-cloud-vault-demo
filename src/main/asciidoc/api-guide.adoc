[[overview-http-media-types]]
= Media types

The *Accept* and *Content-Type* HTTP headers can be used to describe the content being sent or requested within an HTTP request.
The client may set *Accept* to *application/json* if it is requesting a response in JSON. Conversely, when sending data, setting
the *Content-Type* to *application/xml* tells the client that the data being sent in the request is XML.



This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

== Get All Users
=== `GET /users`

==== Path parameters

==== Request
include::{snippets}/get-all-users/http-request.adoc[]

==== Curl request
include::{snippets}/get-all-users/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response

[cols="h,5a"]
|===
| Success
| include::{snippets}/get-all-users/http-response.adoc[][lines=3]

==== Response fields

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
